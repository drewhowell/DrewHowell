## Purpose
Now that I've had some practice with APIs and have a project to share, I am updating my portfolio page and other materials to build toward being employer competitive. Part of being a web developer means being a part of a community. Having a place to share my projects is necessary if I am applying for jobs and is  critical on my journey as a developer.

## Description
My new portfolio is created with bootstrap with a mobile-first design approach. It includes the following content:


-Links to my GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as my email address (phone number included in resume only).

-A link to a PDF of my resume.

-A list of projects: Project title + Link to the deployed version + Link to the GitHub repository + Screenshot of the deployed application.
